    "# Exercise Sheet 2: Timing, Numpy, Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous exercise sheet introduced several methods for classification: decision trees, nearest neighbors, and nearest means. Of those, the one that could learn from the data, and that also offered enough complexity to produce an accurate decision function was k-nearest neighbors. However, nearest neighbors can be slow when implemented in pure Python (i.e. with loops). This is especially the case when the number of data points or input dimensions is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise sheet, we will speed up nearest neighbors by utilizing `numpy`, `scipy` and `scikit-learn` (sklearn) packages. Your task will be to **replace list-based operations by vector-based operations** using numpy arrays. The speed and correctness of the implementations will then be tested. In particular, performance graphs will be drawn using the library `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to have installed all the required packages (numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib). For this you can use `conda install <package>` or `pip install <package>`.\n",

The variable `d` denotes the number of dimensions of each point. The toy dataset is pseudo-random, that is, for fixed parameters, it produces a random-looking dataset, but every time the method is called with the same parameters, the dataset is the same. The pseudo-randomness property will be useful to verify that each nearest neighbor implementation performs the same overall computation.
