The specifics of this will be discussed below, as each component of the network has its own `backward` method that computes such a gradient."

One iteration of this process is called a **batch**. When using mini-batches we'll generally use 64 or 128 samples per batch, but the defining trait is that we're using more than one sample, but not the entire training set. We will do this for a certain number of **epochs**, or passes through the entire training set.\n",

After every epoch we will want to evaluate the model on our validation set. The purpose of the the validation set is to see how well the network generalizes on data it hasn't been trained on. A model can do very well on the data that it is trained on, as it could have easily 'memorized' it, which is why it's important to see how well it performs on data it has never seen. \n",

[`Sequential`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html) itself is a subclass of [`Module`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) which contains more information on the [`Sequential`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html) methods we'll be using in this assignment. \n",

The [`Linear`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) layer only accepts one dimensional tensors equal to its input size, and as such the input needs to be transformed into one, which is just what [`Flatten`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Flatten.html) does. Essentially, a preprocessing step conveniently baked into our network model.\n",

Here we will be specifying our learning rate when instantiating this. We'll instantiate this in the second part, but use it as an argument in the first part.\n",

If it is training, we want to set it to train mode, [`model.train()`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.train), and if not we want set it to evaluation mode, [`model.eval()`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.eval). Further we want to find the **context** which will determine whether we will be tracking gradients, and likewise will be set differently depending if we are trianing or not. If we are training the context should be equal to [`torch.enable_grad()`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.enable_grad.html#enable-grad) and if we are not it should be [`torch.no_grad()`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.no_grad.html#no-grad). We will want to wrap our training loop in a `with` statement that sets this context (i.e. `with context:`). I would recommend setting `context` as a variable before the training loop.\n",

    "1. If we're training, clear all the gradients tracked by the optimizer. This can be done with [`optimizer.zero_grad()`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html#torch.optim.SGD.zero_grad).\n",
    "2. Run the samples through the model. As good practice, be sure to transfer the samples to `device`, or rather `X.to(device)`. \n",
    "3. Calculate the loss.\n",
    "4. If you're training, propagate the loss backwards through the network by calling `loss.backward()`. This will compute the gradients.

    "5. Update the total correct, total number of samples encountered in the epoch thus far, and total loss. When calculating the total correct and the loss, you'll likely need to use the `argmax()` method, and the `item()` method.\n",
